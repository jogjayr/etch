## What is this? ##

I decided to make an Etch-a-sketch. Shake it and everything you've done disappears

## Why? ##

I wanted to try out the [HTML 5 Device Orientation and Motion APIs](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/device/orientation/ "This End Up: Using Device Orientation") and also learn how to use [Jasmine](http://pivotal.github.io/jasmine/ "Jasmine") to learn how to write unit tests.

## How do I use it? ##

Go to [jogjayr.github.io/etch](jogjayr.github.io/etch) and type something. Then shake your device to make whatever you typed fall down. Known to work with the following:

* Macbooks (Air, Pro etc.), that mostly have a built in accelerometer or gyroscope (even works on my 2008 Macbook)
* Smartphones & tablets with gyroscopes

## Does it work well? ##

Err...no. Shake detection is very...sensitive for mobile devices (letters are likely to fall straight down while you type), whereas laptops need a vigorous shake.

## I can't draw with this Etch-a-Sketch ##

Well it's not exactly like the real thing. I'm going to work on it more though (hopefully, assuming I'm not distracted by anything else)
